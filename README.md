# Distance-to-Customers

### Problem

* Have some customer records in a text file (customers.json) -- one customer
  per line, JSON-encoded. 
* Want to invite any customer within 100km of our location. 
* Read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching
  customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
